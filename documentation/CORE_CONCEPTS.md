# Core Concepts

This document explains the core architectural concepts of the Nebula browser.

### Main and Renderer Processes

Electron applications have two types of processes: the **main process** and one or more **renderer processes**.

-   **Main Process**: The main process, which runs the `main.js` script, is the entry point of the application. It runs in a Node.js environment, meaning it has access to all Node.js APIs like `fs` for file system access and `ipcMain` for communication. It is responsible for creating and managing `BrowserWindow` instances, which are the application's windows.

-   **Renderer Process**: Each `BrowserWindow` runs its own renderer process. The renderer process is responsible for rendering web contentâ€”in Nebula's case, the browser's user interface (UI) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The renderer process does not have direct access to Node.js APIs for security reasons.

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Since the main and renderer processes are separate, they need a way to communicate. This is done through Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

-   **`ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer`**: Electron provides the `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer` modules for this purpose. The main process can listen for messages from the renderer process using `ipcMain.handle`, and the renderer process can send messages using `ipcRenderer.invoke`.

-   **Context Bridge and Preload Script**: To securely expose APIs from the main process to the renderer process, Electron uses a **preload script** and the **context bridge**. The `preload.js` script runs in a special environment that has access to both the `window` object of the renderer process and Node.js APIs. The `contextBridge` is used to expose specific functions from the preload script to the renderer process, ensuring that the renderer process cannot access powerful Node.js APIs directly.

### Performance and GPU Management

-   **Performance Monitoring**: The `performance-monitor.js` module helps track the application's performance by monitoring metrics like memory usage and page load times. This is essential for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.

-   **GPU Configuration**: The `gpu-config.js` and `gpu-fallback.js` modules manage GPU acceleration. Electron uses the system's GPU to render content, which can significantly improve performance. However, GPU drivers can sometimes be a source of instability. These modules allow Nebula to check the GPU status and apply fallbacks (like disabling hardware acceleration) if issues are detected, ensuring a more stable experience.
