# Google OAuth Sign-in Debug Guide

## Changes Made to Fix Google Sign-in Issues

### 1. Added Proper User Agent
- Set `useragent` attribute on all webviews to identify as Chrome browser
- User agent: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Nebula/1.0.0`

### 2. Enhanced Webview Security Configuration
- Added `webpreferences` attribute with proper security settings
- Enabled JavaScript and maintained web security while allowing OAuth flows

### 3. Session Configuration for OAuth
- Configured session permissions for OAuth compatibility
- Added cookie change monitoring for Google domains
- Enhanced request headers for better OAuth compatibility
- Added referrer policy for OAuth flows

### 4. Unified Session Partitioning
- Changed all webviews to use `persist:main` partition instead of `persist:default`
- This ensures session data is shared across tabs for OAuth flows

## Testing Google Sign-in

1. **Open the browser** (already running)
2. **Navigate to** any Google service (Gmail, YouTube, Drive, etc.)
3. **Click Sign In** - you should now see the Google account picker
4. **Select your account** - should take you to password/2FA screen
5. **Complete sign-in** - should successfully sign you in

## Debug Information

If issues persist, check the Console (F12) for:
- Cookie changes for Google domains
- OAuth redirect flows
- JavaScript errors

## Common OAuth Issues Fixed

- ✅ Missing User Agent (Google blocks unidentified browsers)
- ✅ Third-party cookie restrictions
- ✅ Session isolation between tabs
- ✅ Missing referrer policies
- ✅ Popup blocking for OAuth flows

## What Should Work Now

- Google account picker should appear
- Password entry screens should load
- Two-factor authentication should work
- OAuth redirects should complete properly
- Session should persist across tabs
