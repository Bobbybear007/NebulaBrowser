## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Bobbybear007/NebulaBrowser.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd NebulaBrowser
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the browser, run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

## Building the Application

To build the application for your platform, run:

```sh
npm run dist
```

This will create a distributable file in the `dist` directory.

Tip (Windows): If you encounter GPU issues, try starting with `start-gpu-safe.bat` to launch in a safer rendering mode.
